# Globant-Coding-Challenge
Goal: Create a Music artists data API.
- Support the following endpoint GET /artist?name=ArtistName
- The data must be human-readable.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
- The response must include the content-type header (application/json)
- Functions must be tested.
- Keep a cache of 2 minutes of the data. You can use a persistence layer for this.

For extra points:

- Create custom exceptions to contemplate possible errors when the endpoint is consumed.
- Upload and deploy the solution to a free cloud service like Heroku.
